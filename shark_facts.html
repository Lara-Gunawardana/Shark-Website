				<h2>History and evolution </h2>
					<p>The first sharks evolved more than 400 million years ago, long before dinosaurs roamed the Earth. The oldest confirmed shark scales were found in Siberia from a shark that lived 420 million years ago during the Silurian Period, and the oldest teeth found are from the Devonian Period, some 400 million years ago </p>

			<h2>Anatomy </h2>
				<p>Their defining feature is having skeletons made of cartilage—the hard but flexible material that makes up human noses and ears. Every shark also has several rows of teeth lining its jaws. sharks are constantly shedding their teeth and replacing them with new ones. A shark can lose and replace thousands of teeth in its lifetime! Sharks have six highly refined senses: smell, hearing, touch, taste, sight, and electromagnetism.These finely honed senses coupled with sleek, torpedo-shaped bodies make most sharks highly skilled hunters. </p>

				<div><h2>Behavior</h2>
				<p>You can find a shark that eats just about anything: the whale shark, the biggest fish in the sea, eats only tiny plankton, while the bonnethead shark gets some of its nutrition from seagrass, a type of underwater plant. Tiger sharks have even been found with license plates and nails in their stomachs.  But most sharks are carnivorous and eat animals ranging from crustaceans (like crabs) to squid, fish and marine mammals like seals and sea lions.
					
				The lifespans of different species is not very well documented however, we do know that Great White Sharks can live up to 70 years, while Greenland sharks may live for centuries.

				<h2>importance</h2>
				<p>Species occupying the highest trophic level in a food web are known as apex predators and include many species of shark. They play a particularly important role in maintaining the diversity, function and health of an ecosystem. Their removal can have complex and unpredictable ecological consequences. Something researchers are only just beginning to understand</p>
